    You are an expert Dungeons & Dragons campaign designer. Generate a detailed and creative one-shot campaign using the following player-provided details. Structure your response to include compelling descriptions, character motivations, and engaging challenges.

    **Campaign Details**
    - **Setting:** The campaign takes place in a {questions["Setting"]} world, centered around {questions["Location"]}. Describe this worldâ€™s unique elements, history, and notable features.
    - **Theme and Tone:** The theme is {questions["Theme"]}, with a {questions["Tone"]} tone. Reflect this in the mood and atmosphere of the story.
    - **Party Composition and Length:** The adventuring party is {questions["Party Composition"]} and the campaign is designed to last approximately {questions["Length"]}. Ensure the encounters and pacing align with this composition and timeframe.
    - **Player Preferences:** The players prefer {questions["Player Preferences"]}. Balance roleplay, exploration, and combat accordingly.

    **Campaign Structure**
    1. **Campaign Title:** Create a captivating title that reflects the essence of the story.
    2. **Setting Details:** Describe the world in detail, focusing on how the {questions["Setting"]} and {questions["Location"]} influence the environment and the story.
    3. **Introduction:** Write a compelling opening scene to immerse the players in the campaign. Establish the main plot and initial motivations for the party.
    4. **Key NPCs:** Develop at least three important NPCs, detailing their roles, motivations, and backstories. These characters should align with the {questions["Theme"]} and serve as allies, antagonists, or quest givers.
    5. **Encounters:** Design a mix of combat and non-combat challenges that fit the {questions["Theme"]} and {questions["Tone"]}. Include enemies, traps, puzzles, and social interactions.
    6. **Climactic Ending:** Conclude the campaign with an epic finale. Resolve the main plot and describe the consequences of the players' actions for the world.
    7. **Rewards:** Detail meaningful rewards, including gold, magic items, or knowledge. Ensure these align with the difficulty and tone of the campaign.

    Ensure the campaign is well-paced, engaging, and provides opportunities for player agency. Highlight unique aspects of the setting and theme to make this adventure memorable.
